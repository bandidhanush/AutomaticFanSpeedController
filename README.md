Efficiently regulate cooling with my Automatic Fan Speed Controller featuring the LM35D temperature sensor. The LM35D detects ambient temperature, allowing a microcontroller (like Arduino) to dynamically adjust the cooling fan speed. This energy-efficient solution ensures optimal temperature conditions, prolonging the lifespan of electronic components. Ideal for home automation, electronic devices, server rooms, and more
